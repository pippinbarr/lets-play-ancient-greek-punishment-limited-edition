**Menu**

Make that

**General**

Make sure all the speeds are at the correct/boring levels

Make sure all the input is frantic clicking and not debugging style

Pause the whole thing when not on screen (because it seems to fuck the animations otherwise? test?)

Make the instructions device-sensitive

**Prometheus**

Right now the eagle still comes back even if you break free (assuming because of confusion between GONE and DEPARTED)

Add ability to switch to an idle frame? In which case make the idle frame depressed (low head)

Sound (peck and liver)

BUG: Couldn’t move after getting up and sitting down the first time (did it pretty immediately)

Also: could use the getX thing to make the movement nicer right?

Doesn’t look like the eagle would come on the second day if you didn’t escape?

**Zeno**

**NO BECAUSE IT’S NOT ABOUT THAT?**Make the idle frame post victory the depressed one

Sound (victory sound on complete)

**Danaids**

Sounds (swoopUp for filling, peck for points?)

**Sisyphus**

Sound

**Tantalus**

Sound (‘peck' for water and fruit points)

Add background and fruit

Fix water so its level can go down over time

Make tantalus animations

Reaching for>taking>eating the fruit

Drinking water (at different levels as it lowers)

Walking back and forth (if they manage to drink all the water)

What the hell does the water number mean?

Fruit number goes up after he’s finished eating the fruit

Okay, well it seems to me we’re about ready to start production. I just fucked around for the morning getting the game to size correctly on mobile and have that working out okay. So it remains to make these things.

**Menu**

Put text in with the level names

Make the level names click/tappable and take you to the appropriate level

**Prometheus**

Add the basic graphics to the screen

**HE WALKS AND SITS**Add the ability to walk on the rocks (how on earth? just a complete animation? aw shit. but that’s it. suck it.)

Add the ability to break the chains

Create the original sequence (since if they don’t struggle it all has to happen)

**Let’s Play: Ancient Greek Punishment 2**

**Let’s Play: Ancient Greek Punishment 2: For a Limited Time Only**

**Let’s Play: Ancient Greek Punishment 2: Free At Last**

**Let’s Play: Ancient Greek Punishment 2: Limited Edition**

**Let’s Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Alternate Ending DLC**

**Let’s Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Limited Edition**

It’s all the same games (and same graphics) except that in every case you can win instead.

**Sisyphus**

You push the rock toward the top, then it starts scrolling, and you reach the top.

*Then*: you just kind of stand there. Maybe you can sit down? On the boulder? Or just lean on it? Or wander up and down the hill .

**Tantalus**

You reach for the apple and get it and eat it. You lean down to the water and drink.

*Then*: You can kind of paddle the water a bit? Just stand around? Maybe walk around in the water. Maybe you can drink all the water away, and then eventually just walk around in the dry area.

**Zeno**

You run across the screen to the final flag.

*Then*: What???? You can just walk around on the screen and that’s it.

**Prometheus**

You struggle enough to break the chains, perhaps you punch out the eagle when it gets to you. Or perhaps better if it just swerves away if you’re not chained down? But the comedy of punching the eagle might be nice? But maybe it’s too satisfying? Night comes and goes.

*Then:* you’re just left sitting there on the rock? Maybe you can walk around on the island? But there’s nothing to do. (This could apply to all of them pretty much)

**Danaids**

You fill the jug and take the water over and the bath fills up.

*Then*: You can hop into the bath and sit there, or walk around on the screen. Maybe walking to one end of the screen gets in the bath. And if you tap/click elsewhere you go over there. So it’s mouse based this time?

**NO** A much more extreme (and probably wrong) option would be to allow them to visit each other and even talk to each other. So you push the rock to the stop and then walk past it to suddenly find Tantalus in his pool etc.

I like the idea that the end state is just a “freedom" to move around the world. But probably best if you’re restricted to your own zone or I’m going to be going off message. The idea is you “win” but then you’re left with nothing. Yes. So the idea that the thing you thought you wanted turned out to be not very satisfying once you got it. I think this works really well as a second kind of commentary on games.

Q: Should I try making this in Unity?

A: Looking at a little bit of internet suggests to me that it’d be more trouble than it’s worth right now.
